<b>This is a Black-Jack game</b>
1. You'll start with 100$ in your bank
2. To play a game part you should make a 10$ bet
3. Your enemy is a computer
4. You can't have more than 3 cards in one game-part
5. Your goal is to score 21 points (or as close to that value as possible)
6. If you get more than 21 or less than 21 (and also less than computer) - you'll lose

Good luck!
